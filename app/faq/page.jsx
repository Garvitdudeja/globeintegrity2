            <>
              Life insurance provides essential financial protection for your loved ones. It is a legally binding contract between you and an insurance company. In exchange for premium payments, your beneficiaries receive a <strong>death benefit</strong> if you pass away while the policy is active. Whether you choose Term Life or <strong>Whole Life Insurance</strong>, this coverage offers peace of mind and long-term security.

              If anyone depends on you financially, life insurance is a smart decision. <strong>Whole Life Insurance</strong> or Term Life Insurance can help ensure your family has the resources to cover living expenses, debts, and future goals in the event of your passing.

              Employer-provided life insurance often offers limited <strong>coverage</strong> and only lasts while you’re employed.

          answer: (

              The <strong>coverage amount</strong> is the amount your life insurance policy pays to your beneficiaries upon your passing. It’s the foundation of your policy. Whether you're choosing Term Life or <strong>Whole Life Insurance</strong>, selecting the right <strong>coverage</strong> ensures your loved ones have financial support when they need it most.

              Most financial experts suggest having life insurance <strong>coverage</strong> equal to <strong>5 to 10 times your annual income</strong>. <strong>Whole Life Insurance</strong> can help you meet this goal while also building long-term <strong>cash value</strong> for added financial flexibility.

          answer: (
            <>
              While life insurance offers broad <strong>coverage</strong>, exclusions may apply. Common situations not covered include:
              <ul className="faqList">
                <li>Suicide within the first two years (varies by state).</li>
                <li>False information provided during the application process.</li>
                <li>Insurance fraud.</li>
                <li>Carrier-specific exclusions, which may be addressed with policy riders.</li>

              The sooner, the better. Life insurance is more affordable when you’re young and healthy.

              A beneficiary is the person or entity you designate to receive the <strong>death benefit</strong> from your life insurance policy.

              Many people maintain life insurance until major financial responsibilities, like a mortgage or supporting dependents, are met. <strong>Whole Life Insurance</strong> offers permanent <strong>coverage</strong> and builds <strong>cash value</strong>, ensuring protection for your entire life, no matter when you pass away.

              Life insurance costs vary based on your age, health, and chosen <strong>coverage</strong> amount. <strong>Whole Life Insurance</strong> generally has higher premiums than Term Life but provides lifelong protection, guaranteed <strong>death benefits</strong>, and builds valuable <strong>cash value</strong>.

        question: "What are the different types of life insurance?",
        answer: <>There are many different types of life insurance to choose from. The most common types consumers purchase are Term Life Insurance, Permanent Life Insurance, or a Combination Policy. What you purchase ultimately depends on your needs and a variety of factors, including how long you need coverage for, how much you want to pay, and whether you’re looking to build cash value over time.</>
      },
      {
        question: "What is Term Life Insurance?",
        answer: <>Term Life Insurance is a type of life insurance policy that provides coverage for a specific period of time, or "term." If the policyholder dies during the term, the policy pays out a death benefit to the beneficiary. If the policyholder does not die during the term, the policy does not pay out and the coverage ends on the expiry date.
          <br />
          Term Life Insurance is typically less expensive than Permanent Life Insurance, however, it does not build cash value or offer tax-advantaged savings like certain types of Permanent Life Insurance.
